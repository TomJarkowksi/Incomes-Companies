# Incomes-Companies

A Incomes-Companies is an application built with Vanilla.js which displays companies' revenues from the database and enables their detailed analysis. After starting the application, you must wait a few moments for the data from the server to be downloaded and correctly displayed. This may take up to a minute. Above the table is the input where you can search for company by its name. After clicking the ID of the company we are interested in you will be redirected to the detailed view.

After clicking the "close" button you will be redirected to the table view with companies. This button should be in the upper right corner.
